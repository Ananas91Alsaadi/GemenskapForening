        "islamParagraph":"Islam, one of the world's major monotheistic religions, emerged in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula through the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Central to Islam is the belief in one God, Allah, and the adherence to the Five Pillars: Shahada (faith), Salah (prayer), Zakat (charity), Sawm (fasting during Ramadan), and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). The Quran, Islam's holy book, is considered the word of God as revealed to Prophet Muhammad. Islam encompasses a rich cultural and spiritual heritage, emphasizing principles of compassion, justice, and community. With over a billion followers worldwide, Islam has diversified into various sects and interpretations, shaping societies and cultures across continents. Its profound influence spans from art and architecture to law and philosophy, making it a significant force in global history and contemporary affairs.",
